## Changelog 


# Aldine 1.0.0 

#### Customisation & Branding

Aldine is the new default network theme for Pressbooks installations. Its creation was supported by [Ryerson University](https://ryerson.ca). Designed with customization in mind, it allows network managers to add institutional branding in the form of colours, logos and contact information, as well as custom content in blocks on the front page.

#### Standalone Catalog

In addition, Aldine introduces a standalone catalog page that is sortable and filterable by subject or license. Adding books to the catalog is controlled in the [same way as before](https://eduguide.pressbooks.com/chapter/catalogs/).

#### Additional Pages

You can now more easily add additional pages to the network root, such as an “About Us” or “Help” page.
